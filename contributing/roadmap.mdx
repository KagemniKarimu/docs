**Summary**

The ‚ÄúZIRCON (Genesis)‚Äù project marks the beginning of a groundbreaking chapter for Chainbase, aiming to build a unified, secure, and decentralized data network. This ambitious initiative seeks to set new standards in data protocols, decentralized computing and storage, and developer incentives. It also focuses on training sophisticated crypto-world models and empowering users with cutting-edge AI tools. As Chainbase evolves, it will support a thriving data ecosystem, enhance protocol efficiency, and serve the ever-expanding needs of Web3.

**Omnichain Data Standards**

Result: Build a standard protocol that can combine and utilize all data on the network.

**Decentralized Network**

Result: Decentralized computing, storage and validation, and providing services.

**Developer Community Economy**

Result: Rewards for developers who create data(manuscripts) value in the network.

**Crypto World Model**

Result: Training crypto-world models to go beyond knowledge and become intelligent.

**Users Empowerment**

Result: Supporting non-expert crypto users with enhanced AI models and tools.

Through efforts in these five key areas, Chainbase will lay a solid foundation for the data ecosystem in the AI era, driving innovation and development in onchain data.
