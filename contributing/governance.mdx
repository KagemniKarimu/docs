Chainbase embraces a governance model based on rough consensus and running code. Changes are driven by proposals, community buy-in, and the implementation of running code. The consensus process involves different stakeholders:

1. **Workers** - Provides blockchain data
2. **Developers** - Build and create manuscripts
3. **Consumers** - Pay CBT query data network
4. **Delegators** - Delegate CBT to worker & secure the network

This model avoids rigid structures, voting, or official roles, promoting action, diversity of viewpoints, and decentralization. Most changes follow the CIP (Chainbase Improvement Proposal) process.
